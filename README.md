# Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes customer behavior and identifies potential churn risks, helping businesses take proactive measures to retain customers.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, feature engineering, and data normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generates visualizations and statistical insights.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements multiple algorithms for churn prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- **Deployment Ready**: Can be integrated into business workflows.

## 🛠️ Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Or install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📌 Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb
```
Follow the instructions inside the notebook to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

## 📊 Results
The model will output churn predictions, classification reports, and visualized insights to help understand customer retention trends.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements
- Improve model accuracy with additional features.
- Implement deep learning-based approaches.
- Deploy as a web application using Streamlit or Flask.
